NAME
    transmission-web is a fork of official Transmission web client before UI
    redesign.

    In 2020 Transmission Web client has been redesigned. This fork saves
    original client look and becomes just another alternative web client. You
    can use it if your prefer original UI over redesigned version, just like
    me. Be aware that this client lacks of some features of mainline client
    version and outdated in some sense. I do not have any plans to backport
    features from upstream, at least for now. Anyway, if you find some feature
    is missing or you would like something to be backported from upstream just
    let me know.

    See https://github.com/transmission/transmission/tree/main/web for official
    Transmission Web client.
