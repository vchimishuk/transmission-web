Welcome to the Clutch WebUI for Transmission!
http://clutchbt.com

Clutch Version 0.4

*** CLUTCH REQUIRES PHP 5.2+ WITH SOCKETS AND JSON ENABLED ***

Instructions For Usage:

1. In order to get started, you must also have transmission-daemon.
We suggest you build from the version 1.00 source, as it is the 
most stable and complete daemon version available at the time of 
this writing.

2. Your httpd / php needs read-write access to the /remote/data 
folder, as this is where it will store your preferences. It also 
needs read-write to the transmission socket and the folder it is in.

3. Edit the socket.txt file in the above folder to point to your 
transmission-daemon socket file. On Linux, this will most likely 
be ~/.transmission/daemon/socket , however, you must use ABSOLUTE 
paths. Using ~ will not work. Substitute in your home folder.

4. After this, as long as transmission-daemon is running, you should 
be able to access the WebUI in the browser of your choice, as long
as it is not Internet Explorer.

Thank you from the developers for using Transmission and Clutch.
